##  Project Overview
This project implements a **Business Intelligence (BI)** solution to optimize the **logistics performance** of specializing in **automotive parts import and distribution**.

Using **Microsoft Power BI**, I designed interactive dashboards that consolidate procurement, storage, distribution, and sales data ‚Äî enabling managers to **track KPIs**, analyze performance, and make **data-driven decisions** in real time.

  -  **Stock & Distribution**
  -  **Commercial & Financial**
- Identify and monitor **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** such as:
  -  Stock-out Rate  
  -  Perfect Order Rate  
  -  Recovery Rate  
  -  Transport Cost
- Provide actionable insights for better decision-making and logistics efficiency.
